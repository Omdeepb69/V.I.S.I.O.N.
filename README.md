*"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk"* - Tony Stark

## Project Overview

**V.I.S.I.O.N.** is a cutting-edge augmented reality assistance system inspired by Stark Industries technology. Designed to provide visually impaired users with an enhanced perception of their surroundings, this system delivers real-time environmental data through an intuitive audio interface.

Unlike other assistive technologies, V.I.S.I.O.N. doesn't just identify obstacles—it creates a complete mental model of the environment, allowing users to navigate their world with unprecedented confidence and independence.

## Mark I Features

- **J.A.R.V.I.S.-Level Scene Analysis**: Advanced object detection and environmental mapping
- **Arc Reactor Powered Voice Interface**: Responsive command system for hands-free operation
- **Iron Legion Obstacle Avoidance Protocol**: Predictive navigation assistance
- **Friday Emergency Response System**: Intelligent handling of dangerous situations
- **Stark Memory Core**: Familiar location recognition and mapping

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the secure repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/V.I.S.I.O.N..git
cd V.I.S.I.O.N.
```

2. Initialize containment field (virtual environment):
```bash
python -m venv stark_env
source stark_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: stark_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install component modules:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Operation Manual

1. Activate V.I.S.I.O.N. core systems:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Once online, the system will begin scanning the environment through camera input.

3. Available Voice Commands:
- "Scan surroundings" - Analyze and describe current environment
- "Location check" - Determine current position and orientation
- "Deploy S.H.I.E.L.D." - Activate emergency assistance protocols
- "Power down" - Deactivate system

## Configuration Parameters

System parameters can be modified through the `stark_settings.py` file or via the included configuration interface. Critical settings include:

- **Optical Sensors**: Camera parameters and processing intensity
- **Voice Synthesis**: Response style, speed, and personality
- **Arc Audio System**: 3D audio positioning and intensity
- **Navigator Protocols**: Mapping resolution and obstacle thresholds
- **S.H.I.E.L.D. Response**: Emergency contacts and activation parameters

## Power Requirements

- **OpenCV**: Primary visual cortex
- **NumPy**: Mathematical processing unit
- **SpeechRecognition**: Audio input decoder
- **pyttsx3**: Voice synthesis module
- **sounddevice**: Audio generation system
- **SciPy**: Advanced mathematics co-processor
- **Pillow**: Image enhancement module
- **PyAudio**: Audio I/O interface
